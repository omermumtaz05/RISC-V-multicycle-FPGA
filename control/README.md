**This directory contains the control modules needed for testing and simulation.**

The `individual_control/` directory contains the core control modules: `FSM.v` and `ALUControl.v`, and `full_control.v` contains both modules.

The FSM was based on the design from *Computer Organization and Design: RISC V, 2nd edition*, along with an additional state (state 9) to support `addi` instructions as shown below.
