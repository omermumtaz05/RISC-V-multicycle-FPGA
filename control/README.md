**This directory contains the control modules needed for testing and simulation.**

`individual_control/` directory contains the modules needed for control, `FSM.v` and `ALUControl.v`. `full_control.v` has both modules.

The FSM was used from the book Computer Organization and Design: RISC V 2nd edition, along with a new state (state 9) for `addi` instruction support shown below.
