This directory contains three directories:
- `instruction_sequence1/`
- `instruction_sequence2/`
- `instruction_sequence3/`

Which correspond with the instruction sequences found in the `datapath/instruction_sequences` directory

Each directory has images from ModelSim simulations which observe the behavior of the necessary registers and data memory addresses after each instruction for full CPU verification.
