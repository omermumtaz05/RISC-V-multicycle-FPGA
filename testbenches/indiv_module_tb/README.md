**This directory contains testbenches for all individual datapath and control module.**

Each module's corresponding testbench file is named using the format `*_tb.v`.

For testing, use Icarus Verilog on EDAplayground and view the displayed outputs.

Each testbench sets input values to check the expected output control signals and data values. Output values are displayed at the necessary clock cycles for verification.
