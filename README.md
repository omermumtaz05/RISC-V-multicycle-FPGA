Welcome! This repository has the Verilog code for the datapath and control for a 32-bit multicycle RISC-V processor, along with testbenches for verification.

The processor has been fully verified for all instruction types (R-type, lw, sw, beq, and addi), along with negative immediate values, attempting to store values into x0 and lw/sw memory consistency. More details on instruction sequences can be found in the directory datapath/instruction_sequences.
