RISC V 32-bit multicycle processor. Capable of running beq, lw, sw, addi, and all r-type instructions. Verified fully with negative immediates on lw, sw, addi, and beq, x0 only storing 32'b0, beq not branching when two registers not equal, and memory consistency with storing a word into an address and loading it directly into a register right after.
